//! Ethy Pallet ðŸŒ‰
//!
//! This pallet defines m-of-n protocols for validators to agree on values from a bridged
//! Ethereum chain (Ethereum JSON-RPC compliant), and conversely, generate proofs of events that
//! have occurred on the network
//!
//! The proofs are a collection of signatures which can be verified by a bridged contract on
//! Ethereum with awareness of the current validator set.
//!
//! There are 2 types of Ethereum values the bridge can verify:
//! 1) verify a transaction hash exists that executed a specific contract producing a specific event
//! log 2) verify the `returndata` of executing a contract at some time _t_ with input `i`
//!
//! CENNZnet validators use an offchain worker and Ethereum full node connections to independently
//! verify and observe events happened on Ethereum.
//! Once a threshold of validators sign a notarization having witnessed the event it is considered
//! verified.
//!
//! Events are opaque to this pallet, other pallet handle submitting "event claims" and "callbacks"
//! to handle success
