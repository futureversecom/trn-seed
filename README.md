## ‚öôÔ∏è Running

### Run using docker image

Docker images are published for every tagged release, you can quickly have a node running without pulling down the source code and build

```bash
# Root chainspec
docker run -p 9933:9933 -p 9944:9944 -p 30333:30333 ghcr.io/futureversecom/seed:latest --chain=root
# Porcini chainspec
docker run -p 9933:9933 -p 9944:9944 -p 30333:30333 ghcr.io/futureversecom/seed:latest --chain=porcini
# Dev chainspec
docker run -p 9933:9933 -p 9944:9944 -p 30333:30333 ghcr.io/futureversecom/seed:latest --dev --unsafe-rpc-external --unsafe-ws-external --rpc-cors=all
```

### Run using source code

First install Rust. You may need to add Cargo's bin directory to your PATH environment variable.

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

If you already have Rust installed, make sure you're using the latest version by running:

```bash
rustup update
```

Build the client by cloning this repository and running the following commands from the root directory of the repo:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

After building the source code, run the following commands to start the node.

```bash
# Root chainspec
./target/release/seed --chain=root
# Porcini chainspec
./target/release/seed --chain=porcini
# Dev chainspec
./target/release/seed --dev --unsafe-rpc-external --unsafe-ws-external --rpc-cors=all
```

## üöß Development

### Getting the right toolchain

To get the right toolchain execute the following command:

```bash
rustup show
```

### Run Unit Tests

```bash
cargo test
```
### Run E2E Tests

Refer to the instruction [here](./e2e)

### Formatting & Linting
```
cargo fmt
```

### Benchmarks
